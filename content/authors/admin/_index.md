I am a second year computer science PhD student at Dartmouth College. 
My research interest includes physically based rendering, real-time rendering and neural rendering.
Currently I am researching ToF rendering.
I received master's degree from Seoul National University [3D vision lab](http://3d.snu.ac.kr/). 
I also received bachelor's degree from Seoul National University.
